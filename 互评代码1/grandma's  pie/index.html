    <h3>Instructions about Pie</h3>
    <cite>
    <q><p>A pie is a baked dish which is usually made of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastry">pastry</a> dough casing that covers or completely contains a filling of various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweetness">sweet</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umami">savoury</a> ingredients.</p>
    <p>Pies are defined by their crusts. A filled pie (also single-crust or bottom-crust), has pastry lining the baking dish, and the filling is placed on top of the pastry but left open. A top-crust pie has the filling in the bottom of the dish and is covered with a pastry or other covering before baking. A two-crust pie has the filling completely enclosed in the pastry shell. Shortcrust pastry is a typical kind of pastry used for pie crusts, but many things can be used, including baking powder biscuits, mashed potatoes, and crumbs.</p>
    <p>Pies can be a variety of sizes, ranging from bite-size to ones designed for multiple servings.</p></q>
